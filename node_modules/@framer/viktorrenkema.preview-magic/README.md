### Preview Magic

Preview Magic allows you to override the default background color in the Preview (`CMD` + `P`) window. 

Just select a color setting from the properties panel to the right, open up the Preview and voila!

The five different properties are as follows:

| Property | Description |
|--|--|
| *Color* | Pick a solid color with the color picker. |
|*Linear Gradient*|Use the color pickers to pick the start and finish color stops to create a linear gradient.|
|*Radial Gradient*|Use the color pickers to pick the inner and outer color stops to create a radial gradient.|
|*CSS*|Paste or type the exact CSS value for the `Background` property. |
|*Image*|Select an image file from your device.|
